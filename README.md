A collection of role playing notes and resources for a setting based on the [Travelers TV series][wikipedia]. All information, other than general background and world-building, is designed to be used with the [HERO System][hero].

In a post-apocalyptic future, the human race is on the brink of extinction. An AI called "The Director" oversees all aspects of human existence to preserve and revitalize the human race and make the Earth fully habitable once again. To that end, when a means of transferring human consciousness from one body to another even across time is discovered, The Director uses information from the historical record to send operatives called "Travelers" in teams of five back to the 21st century to change history in large and small ways to avert the coming apocalypse.

> **Note:** While the [Travelers Wiki][travelers-wiki] may be considered by some to be the canonical resource on Travelers worldbuilding information, I plan to use my own interpretation of the events from the TV series. This is because it is never completely made clear if some of the Protocols and other information that shows up in later episodes of the television series are from the initial timeline, that I refer to as T1, or from timelines resulting from alterations to the future made in the 21st century by travelers. See the [Timelines](./timelines.md) section for more information.

> For this reason and for the purposes of this role play setting, where this repository disagrees with the Travelers Wiki, the information in this repository is to be considered correct.

## The Traveler's Oath

> We, the last unbroken remnants, vow to undo the errors of our ascendants, to make the Earth whole, the lost unlost, at peril of our own birth.
