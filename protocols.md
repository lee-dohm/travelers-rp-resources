# Protocols

All Travelers are given six protocols that are to be followed absolutely and without question. Disobeying these protocols can jeapordize The Grand Plan.

1. The mission comes first.
2. Leave the future in the past.
3. Don't take a life, don't save a life, unless otherwise directed. Do not interfere.
4. Do not reproduce.
5. In the absence of direction, maintain your host's life.
6. Do not communicate with other known travelers outside of your team unless sanctioned by the Director.
